A Java-based employee management system developed as a technical test for **Projedata**.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a small employee management system for an industry, featuring core object-oriented concepts and data processing in Java. The system enables management and reporting of employee data, salary updates, grouping, and various queries, all via a simple command-line interface.

## Features

- **Person and Employee Classes:** `Person`: name and date of birth. `Employee` (extends `Person`): salary and job title.


- **Operations:**
- Insert all employees from a given list.
- Remove an employee named "Jo√£o".
- Print all employee details: Dates formatted as `dd/MM/yyyy`. Salaries formatted with thousand separators (`.`) and decimals as comma (`,`).
- Apply a 10% salary increase to all employees.
- Group employees by their job title in a `Map`.
- Print employees grouped by job title.
- Print employees with birthdays in October and December.
- Print the oldest employee (name and age).
- Print employees sorted alphabetically by name.
- Print the sum of all employees' salaries.
- Print how many minimum wages each employee earns (minimum wage: R$1.518,00).
